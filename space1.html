                <h1>REUSABILITY: THE KEY TO MAKING HUMAN LIFE MULTI-PLANETARY</h1>
            </div>

                “If one can figure out how to effectively reuse rockets just like airplanes, the cost of access to
                space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred. A fully reusable vehicle has never been done
                before. That really is the fundamental breakthrough needed to revolutionize access to space.”

                --Elon Musk

                SpaceX believes a fully and rapidly reusable rocket is the pivotal breakthrough needed to substantially
                reduce the cost of space access. The majority of the launch cost comes from building the rocket, which
                flies only once. Compare that to a commercial airliner – each new plane costs about the same as Falcon
                9, but can fly multiple times per day, and conduct tens of thousands of flights over its lifetime.
                Following the commercial model, a rapidly reusable space launch vehicle could reduce the cost of
                traveling to space by a hundredfold.

                While most rockets are designed to burn up on reentry, SpaceX rockets can not only withstand reentry,
                but can also successfuly land back on Earth and refly again.


                World’s First Orbital-Class Rocket Reflight

                In March 2017, SpaceX achieved the world’s first reflight of an orbital class rocket. SpaceX’s Falcon 9
                rocket launched a geosynchronous communications satellite on March 30, 2017, from Launch Complex 39A
                (LC-39A) at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The first stage for the mission previously
                supported a space station cargo resupply launch for NASA in April 2016. Following stage separation, the
                first stage successfully returned to Earth for a second time, landing on a drone ship stationed in the
                Atlantic ocean. This successful reflight represents a historic milestone on the road to full and rapid
                rocket reusability.
